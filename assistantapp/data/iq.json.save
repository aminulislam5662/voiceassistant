    "question": "tell me about Hazrat Muhammad (s)",
    "answer": "Druze tradition honors several \"mentors\" and \"prophets\",[414] and Muhammad is considered an important prophet of God in the Druze faith, being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history.[415][416] In response to the first query, the Qur'an tells a story about a group of men sleeping in a cave (Qur'an 18:9\u201325), which scholars generally link to the legend of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus. For the second query, the Qur'an speaks of Dhu al-Qarnayn, literally \"he of the two horns\" (Qur'an 18:93\u201399), a tale that academics widely associate with the Alexander Romance.[102][103] As for the third query, concerning the nature of the spirit, the Qur'anic revelation asserted that it was beyond human comprehension. Neither the Jews who devised the questions nor the Quraysh who posed them to Muhammad converted to Islam upon receiving the answers.[101] Nadr and Uqba were later executed on Muhammad's orders after the Battle of Badr, while other captives were held for ransom. As Uqba pleaded, \"But who will take care of my children, Muhammad?\" Muhammad responded, \"Hell!\"[104][105][106][107] While Tabari and Ibn Hisham mentioned only one migration to Abyssinia, there were two sets according to Ibn Sa'd. Of these two, the majority of the first group returned to Mecca before the event of Hijra, while the majority of the second group remained in Abyssinia at the time and went directly to Medina after the event of Hijra. These accounts agree that persecution played a major role in Muhammad sending them there. According to historian W. M. Watt, the episodes were more complex than the traditional accounts suggest, he proposes that there were divisions within the embryonic Muslim community, and that they likely went there to trade in competition with the prominent merchant families of Mecca. In Urwa's letter preserved by Tabari, these emigrants returned after the conversion to Islam of a number of individuals in positions such as Hamza and Umar.[111] Along with many others,[112] Tabari recorded that Muhammad was desperate, hoping for an accommodation with his tribe. So, while he was in the presence of a number of Quraysh, after delivering verses mentioning three of their favorite deities (Quran 53:19\u201320), Satan put upon his tongue two short verses: \"These are the high flying ones / whose intercession is to be hoped for.\" This led to a general reconciliation between Muhammad and the Meccans, and the Muslims in Abyssinia began to return home. However, the next day, Muhammad retracted these verses at the behest of Gabriel, claiming that they had been cast by Satan to his tongue and God had abrogated them.  Instead, verses that revile those goddesses were then revealed.[113][h][i] The returning Muslims thus had to make arrangements for clan protection before they could re-enter Mecca.[11][114] This Satanic verses incident was reported en masse and documented by nearly all of the major biographers of Muhammad in Islam's first two centuries,[115] which according to them corresponds to Quran 22:52. But since the rise of the hadith movement and systematic theology with its new doctrines, including the isma, which claimed that Muhammad was infallible and thus could not be fooled by Satan, the historical memory of the early community has been reevaluated. And as of the 20th century CE, Muslim scholars unanimously rejected this incident.[112] On the other hand, most European biographers of Muhammad recognize the veracity of this incident of satanic verses on the basis of the criterion of embarrassment. Historian Alfred T. Welch proposes that the period of Muhammad's turning away from strict monotheism was likely far longer but was later encapsulated in a story that made it much shorter and imputed Satan as the culprit.[111] "

    "question": "tell me about Quran",
    "answer": "summarize Many passages of the Qur\u02be\u0101n are devoted to describing the eschatological judgment through which God will consign each human being to paradise or hell and portraying the ensuing rewards of the saved and torments of the damned. There are also narratives, some of which centre on biblical persons, such as Adam, Moses, Jesus, and Mary. Narrative passages include brief reminiscences (e.g., 85:17\u201318) as well as much more extensive accounts (e.g., the 12th s\u016brah, devoted to the story of Joseph). Regardless of their length, these stories are generally retold in an allusive style that would appear to presuppose that they were already known to their target audience. The stress is not on details of the narrative plots but on their didactic significance, which is often explicitly pointed out by means of interjected comments. In many cases, Qur\u02be\u0101nic narratives show important parallels not merely to certain biblical passages but also to postbiblical Rabbinic and Christian texts. For example, the story of Abraham\u2019s dispute with his idolatrous father and his destruction of his people\u2019s false deities (e.g., 37:83\u201398) is not found in the book of Genesis itself but only in later texts, such as a Rabbinic commentary on Genesis. The mediation of those narrative traditions into the Qur\u02be\u0101n\u2019s environment may very well have relied on oral transmission rather than written texts. Even where the Qur\u02be\u0101n retells previously attested stories, it normally does so by harnessing them to its own theological agenda. The Qur\u02be\u0101n\u2019s demonstrable overlap with earlier traditions is patently in line with its self-description as providing a \u201cconfirmation\u201d of previous revelations (e.g., 2:97).The Qur\u02be\u0101n is markedly shorter than even the New Testament, let alone the Hebrew Bible. It is subdivided into 114 chapterlike units called \u201cs\u016brahs,\u201d a word used within the Qur\u02be\u0101n to designate revelatory passages of an unspecific length (e.g., 9:64). With the exception of the short opening s\u016brah, recited during each of the five daily Islamic prayers, the s\u016brahs are ordered roughly according to decreasing length, although this general rule is frequently interrupted. The second s\u016brah is by far the longest one. All s\u016brahs are traditionally known by names\u2014many of them by more than one\u2014which appear to have emerged only after the death of the Prophet. S\u016brah names are usually derived from some conspicuous word in the respective text, such as \u201cThe Cow\u201d (the second) or \u201cThe Poets\u201d (the 26th), though they do not necessarily identify a text\u2019s main theme. Each s\u016brah, apart from the ninth, is preceded by the so-called basmalah, the formulaic invocation \u201cIn the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.\u201d Many s\u016brahs (e.g., the second) are opened by detached Arabic letters, the meaning of which has not yet been satisfactorily explained.The Qur\u02be\u0101n generally styles itself as divine speech by employing the first person singular or plural (\u201cI\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) in statements that clearly refer to the Deity. However, this divine voice alternates with third-person statements about God. Utterances by Muhammad are normally introduced by the command \u201cSay:\u2026,\u201d thus emphasizing that the Prophet is speaking on divine injunction only. Prophetic statements often respond to objections or denials ascribed to Muhammad\u2019s opponents, which cast doubt on Qur\u02be\u0101nic doctrines such as the belief in a universal resurrection of the dead or in the existence of only one God. This can result in an extended to-and-fro that endows parts of the Qur\u02be\u0101n with a decidedly polemical and disputatious quality.Qur\u02be\u0101n, (Arabic: \u201cRecitation\u201d) also spelled Quran and Koran,  the sacred scripture of Islam. According to conventional Islamic belief, the Qur\u02be\u0101n was revealed by the angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad in the West Arabian towns Mecca and Medina beginning in 610 and ending with Muhammad\u2019s death in 632 ce. The word qur\u02be\u0101n, which occurs already within the Islamic scripture itself (e.g., 9:111 and 75:17\u201318), is derived from the verb qara\u02bea\u2014\u201cto read,\u201d \u201cto recite\u201d\u2014but there is probably also some connection with the Syriac qery\u0101n\u0101, \u201creading,\u201d used for the recitation of scriptural readings during church services.

Regardless of their length, these stories are generally retold in an allusive style that would appear to presuppose that they were already known to their target audience. The stress is not on details of the narrative plots but on their didactic significance, which is often explicitly pointed out by means of interjected comments. In many cases, Qur\u02be\u0101nic narratives show important parallels not merely to certain biblical passages but also to postbiblical Rabbinic and Christian texts. For example, the story of Abraham\u2019s dispute with his idolatrous father and his destruction of his people\u2019s false deities (e.g., 37:83\u201398) is not found in the book of Genesis itself but only in later texts, such as a Rabbinic commentary on Genesis. The mediation of those narrative traditions into the Qur\u02be\u0101n\u2019s environment may very well have relied on oral transmission rather than written texts. Even where the Qur\u02be\u0101n retells previously attested stories, it normally does so by harnessing them to its own theological agenda. The Qur\u02be\u0101n\u2019s demonstrable overlap with earlier traditions is patently in line with its self-description as providing a \u201cconfirmation\u201d of previous revelations (e.g., 2:97).The Qur\u02be\u0101n is markedly shorter than even the New Testament, let alone the Hebrew Bible. It is subdivided into 114 chapterlike units called \u201cs\u016brahs,\u201d a word used within the Qur\u02be\u0101n to designate revelatory passages of an unspecific length (e.g., 9:64). With the exception of the short opening s\u016brah, recited during each of the five daily Islamic prayers, the s\u016brahs are ordered roughly according to decreasing length, although this general rule is frequently interrupted. The second s\u016brah is by far the longest one. All s\u016brahs are traditionally known by names\u2014many of them by more than one\u2014which appear to have emerged only after the death of the Prophet. S\u016brah names are usually derived from some conspicuous word in the respective text, such as \u201cThe Cow\u201d (the second) or \u201cThe Poets\u201d (the 26th), though they do not necessarily identify a text\u2019s main theme. Each s\u016brah, apart from the ninth, is preceded by the so-called basmalah, the formulaic invocation \u201cIn the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate.\u201d Many s\u016brahs (e.g., the second) are opened by detached Arabic letters, the meaning of which has not yet been satisfactorily explained.The Qur\u02be\u0101n generally styles itself as divine speech by employing the first person singular or plural (\u201cI\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d) in statements that clearly refer to the Deity. However, this divine voice alternates with third-person statements about God. Utterances by Muhammad are normally introduced by the command \u201cSay:\u2026,\u201d thus emphasizing that the Prophet is speaking on divine injunction only. Prophetic statements often respond to objections or denials ascribed to Muhammad\u2019s opponents, which cast doubt on Qur\u02be\u0101nic doctrines such as the belief in a universal resurrection of the dead or in the existence of only one God. This can result in an extended to-and-fro that endows parts of the Qur\u02be\u0101n with a decidedly polemical and disputatious quality.Qur\u02be\u0101n, (Arabic: \u201cRecitation\u201d) also spelled Quran and Koran,  the sacred scripture of Islam. According to conventional Islamic belief, the Qur\u02be\u0101n was revealed by the angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad in the West Arabian towns Mecca and Medina beginning in 610 and ending with Muhammad\u2019s death in 632 ce. The word qur\u02be\u0101n, which occurs already within the Islamic scripture itself (e.g., 9:111 and 75:17\u201318), is derived from the verb qara\u02bea\u2014\u201cto read,\u201d \u201cto recite\u201d\u2014but there is probably also some connection with the Syriac qery\u0101n\u0101, \u201creading,\u201d used for the recitation of scriptural readings during church services. The Qur\u02be\u0101nic corpus, composed in an early form of Classical Arabic, is traditionally believed to be a literal transcript of God\u2019s speech and to constitute the earthly reproduction of an uncreated and eternal heavenly original, according to the general view referred to in the Qur\u02be\u0101n itself as \u201cthe well-preserved tablet\u201d (al-law\u1e25 al-mahf\u016b\u1e93; Qur\u02be\u0101n 85:22).The Qur\u02be\u0101n forms the bedrock of Islamic law, even though many legal details are derived not from scripture but from extra-Qur\u02be\u0101nic utterances and actions attributed to Muhammad\u2014the so-called \u1e24ad\u012bth. Most of the Qur\u02be\u0101n\u2019s legal or quasi-legal pronouncements are concentrated in a few of the longest s\u016brahs, the most extensive block of such material being 2:153\u2013283. The domains covered by Qur\u02be\u0101nic law include matters of family law (e.g., inheritance rules), ritual law (e.g., the performance of ablution before prayer or the duty to fast during the month of Ramadan), dietary regulations (e.g., the prohibition of consuming pork or wine), criminal law (e.g., the punishment for theft or for manslaughter), and commercial law (the prohibition of usury). Concrete behavioral prescriptions are not expounded in a systematic order and can be presented as responses to audience queries\u2014for instance, at 5:4, \u201cThey ask you what is permitted to them [to eat].

    "question": "what is proton?",
    "answer": "CPT-symmetry puts strong constraints on the relative properties of particles and antiparticles and, therefore, is open to stringent tests. For example, the charges of a proton and antiproton must sum to exactly zero. This equality has been tested to one part in 108. The equality of their masses has also been tested to better than one part in 108. By holding antiprotons in a Penning trap, the equality of the charge-to-mass ratio of protons and antiprotons has been tested to one part in 6\u00d7109.[58] The magnetic moment of antiprotons has been measured with an error of 8\u00d710\u22123 nuclear Bohr magnetons, and is found to be equal and opposite to that of a proton.[59] However, in 2010 an international research team published a proton charge radius measurement via the Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen (an exotic atom made of a proton and a negatively charged muon). As a muon is 200 times heavier than an electron, its de Broglie wavelength is correspondingly shorter.  This smaller atomic orbital is much more sensitive to the proton's charge radius, so allows more precise measurement.  Their measurement of the root-mean-square charge radius of a proton is \"0.84184(67)\u00a0fm, which differs by 5.0 standard deviations from the CODATA value of 0.8768(69)\u00a0fm\".[47] In January 2013, an updated value for the charge radius of a proton\u20140.84087(39)\u00a0fm\u2014was published. The precision was improved by 1.7 times, increasing the significance of the discrepancy to 7\u03c3.[13] The 2014 CODATA adjustment slightly reduced the recommended value for the proton radius (computed using electron measurements only) to 0.8751(61)\u00a0fm, but this leaves the discrepancy at 5.6\u03c3. The problem of defining a radius for an atomic nucleus (proton) is similar to the problem of atomic radius, in that neither atoms nor their nuclei have definite boundaries. However, the nucleus can be modeled as a sphere of positive charge for the interpretation of electron scattering experiments: because there is no definite boundary to the nucleus, the electrons \"see\" a range of cross-sections, for which a mean can be taken. The qualification of \"rms\" (for \"root mean square\") arises because it is the nuclear cross-section, proportional to the square of the radius, which is determining for electron scattering.[dubious  \u2013 discuss] The internal dynamics of protons are complicated, because they are determined by the quarks' exchanging gluons, and interacting with various vacuum condensates. Lattice QCD provides a way of calculating the mass of a proton directly from the theory to any accuracy, in principle. The most recent calculations[41][42] claim that the mass is determined to better than 4% accuracy, even to 1% accuracy (see Figure S5 in D\u00fcrr et al.[42]). These claims are still controversial, because the calculations cannot yet be done with quarks as light as they are in the real world. This means that the predictions are found by a process of extrapolation, which can introduce systematic errors.[43] It is hard to tell whether these errors are controlled properly, because the quantities that are compared to experiment are the masses of the hadrons, which are known in advance. The constituent quark model wavefunction for the proton is       |   p  \u2191   \u27e9 =    1  18      (  2  |   u  \u2191    d  \u2193    u  \u2191   \u27e9 + 2  |   u  \u2191    u  \u2191    d  \u2193   \u27e9 + 2  |   d  \u2193    u  \u2191    u  \u2191   \u27e9 \u2212  |   u  \u2191    u  \u2193    d  \u2191   \u27e9 \u2212  |   u  \u2191    d  \u2191    u  \u2193   \u27e9 \u2212  |   u  \u2193    d  \u2191    u  \u2191   \u27e9 \u2212  |   d  \u2191    u  \u2193    u  \u2191   \u27e9 \u2212  |   d  \u2191    u  \u2191    u  \u2193   \u27e9 \u2212  |   u  \u2193    u  \u2191    d  \u2191   \u27e9  )   .   {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {|p_{\\uparrow }\\rangle ={\\tfrac {1}{\\sqrt {18}}}\\left(2|u_{\\uparrow }d_{\\downarrow }u_{\\uparrow }\\rangle +2|u_{\\uparrow }u_{\\uparrow }d_{\\downarrow }\\rangle +2|d_{\\downarrow }u_{\\uparrow }u_{\\uparrow }\\rangle -|u_{\\uparrow }u_{\\downarrow }d_{\\uparrow }\\rangle -|u_{\\uparrow }d_{\\uparrow }u_{\\downarrow }\\rangle -|u_{\\downarrow }d_{\\uparrow }u_{\\uparrow }\\rangle -|d_{\\uparrow }u_{\\downarrow }u_{\\uparrow }\\rangle -|d_{\\uparrow }u_{\\uparrow }u_{\\downarrow }\\rangle -|u_{\\downarrow }u_{\\uparrow }d_{\\uparrow }\\rangle \\right)} .}   "

    "question": "tell me about Hazrat Muhammad (s)",
    "answer": "Muhammad was the prophet and founder of Islam. Most of his early life was spent as a merchant. At age 40, he began to have revelations from Allah that became the basis for the Koran and the foundation of Islam. By 630 he had unified most of Arabia under a single religion. As of 2015, there are over 1.8 billion Muslims in the world who profess, \u201cThere is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet.\u201dMuhammad was a prophet and founder of Islam.After the conflict with Mecca was finally settled, Muhammad took his first true Islamic pilgrimage to that city and in March, 632, he delivered his last sermon at Mount Arafat. Upon his return to Medina to his wife\u2019s home, he fell ill for several days. He died on June 8, 632, at the age of 62, and was buried at al-Masjid an-Nabawi (the Mosque of the Prophet) one of the first mosques built by Muhammad in Medina. Islamic tradition holds that the first persons to believe were his wife, Khadija and his close friend Abu Bakr (regarded as the successor to Muhammad by Sunni Muslims). Soon, Muhammad began to gather a small following, initially encountering no opposition. Most people in Mecca either ignored him or mocked him as just another prophet. However, when his message condemned idol worship and polytheism, many of Mecca\u2019s tribal leaders began to see Muhammad and his message as a threat. Besides going against long standing beliefs, the condemnation of idol worship had economic consequences for merchants who catered to the thousands of pilgrims who came to Mecca every year. This was especially true for members of Muhammad\u2019s own tribe, the Quraysh, who were the guardians of the Kaaba. Sensing a threat, Mecca\u2019s merchants and leaders offered Muhammad incentives to abandon his preaching, but he refused.Muhammad was born around 570, AD in Mecca (now in Saudi Arabia). His father died before he was born and he was raised first by his grandfather and then his uncle. He belonged to a poor but respectable family of the Quraysh tribe. The family was active in Meccan politics and trade."

    "question": "who is the current president of bangladesh?",
    "answer": "The role of the president has changed three times since Bangladesh achieved independence in 1971. Presidents had been given executive power. In 1991, with the restoration of a democratically elected government, Bangladesh adopted a parliamentary democracy based on a Westminster system. The President is now a largely ceremonial post elected by the Parliament.[2] Chancellor is a titular position at universities in Bangladesh, always held by the incumbent president of Bangladesh under the Private Universities Act 1992.[6] The position in public universities is not fixed for the president under any acts or laws (since the erection of a state university in Bangladesh requires an act to be passed in itself),[7] but it has been the custom so far to name the incumbent president of the country as chancellor of all state universities thus established. The Constitution of Bangladesh sets the principal qualifications one must meet to be eligible to the office of the president.[8] A person shall not be qualified for election as president if he- Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was the apparent acting president of a state yet to be known as Bangladesh (during the Liberation war of Bangladesh, when it was still called East Pakistan, before he was captured, taken to West Pakistan, and kept in a Pakistani prison. His imprisonment therefore resulted in his absence during the entire war-time, which lasted almost a year. In his absence, Syed Nazrul Islam, vice-president of the Provisional Government of Bangladesh was appointed as acting president). Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was the founder of Bangladesh and remarked as the 'Father of the Bangladesh Nation'. He headed the Awami League, served as the president from April 1971 to 1972; was the prime minister from 1972 and the president in 1975. He is popularly referred to as Sheikh Mujib, and with the honorary title of Bangabandhu (\u09ac\u0999\u09cd\u0997\u09ac\u09a8\u09cd\u09a7\u09c1 B\u00f4ngobondhu, \"Friend of Bengal\"). His eldest daughter Sheikh Hasina Wajed is the present leader of the Awami League and the current prime minister of Bangladesh. He introduced the state policy of Bangladesh according to four basic principles: nationalism, secularism, democracy and socialism.[14] At the beginning of the Bangladesh war of independence in April 1970, Bangladesh Forces and Bangladesh Government in exile were both established. After the oath ceremony was held at Meherpur, Kushtia, the government-in-exile set up its headquarters at 8 Theatre Road, in Kolkata (then Calcutta), India. The first president of Bangladesh was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the first vice president to take oath of office was Syed Nazrul Islam with Tajuddin Ahmad as the first prime minister. After the war ended, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman became the prime minister with the election of the first parliament a year later in January, 1972. "
