    "answer": "       House Republicans are once again scrambling with no clear path to elect a new speaker after voting to push Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan out of the race, the latest sign of the chaos and divisions that have engulfed the majority party and left the chamber in a state of paralysis.           A closed-door House GOP conference meeting on Thursday turned heated, multiple sources told CNN. Some members encouraged Jordan to drop out of the race. There was also an emotional discussion over the threats some Jordan holdouts are facing. Later, members leaving the meeting described it as an airing of grievances with tensions running high.          A number of Republicans left Friday\u2019s closed-door meeting sounding more confused than ever about the path forward and who is best to lead them. Many expressed frustration and some called for reflection after the collapse of Jordan\u2019s speakership bid. \u201cWe\u2019re back to square one,\u201d South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson said.

    "answer": "Muhammad was the prophet and founder of Islam. Most of his early life was spent as a merchant. At age 40, he began to have revelations from Allah that became the basis for the Koran and the foundation of Islam. By 630 he had unified most of Arabia under a single religion. As of 2015, there are over 1.8 billion Muslims in the world who profess, \u201cThere is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet.\u201dMuhammad was a prophet and founder of Islam.After the conflict with Mecca was finally settled, Muhammad took his first true Islamic pilgrimage to that city and in March, 632, he delivered his last sermon at Mount Arafat. Upon his return to Medina to his wife\u2019s home, he fell ill for several days. He died on June 8, 632, at the age of 62, and was buried at al-Masjid an-Nabawi (the Mosque of the Prophet) one of the first mosques built by Muhammad in Medina. Islamic tradition holds that the first persons to believe were his wife, Khadija and his close friend Abu Bakr (regarded as the successor to Muhammad by Sunni Muslims). Soon, Muhammad began to gather a small following, initially encountering no opposition. Most people in Mecca either ignored him or mocked him as just another prophet. However, when his message condemned idol worship and polytheism, many of Mecca\u2019s tribal leaders began to see Muhammad and his message as a threat. Besides going against long standing beliefs, the condemnation of idol worship had economic consequences for merchants who catered to the thousands of pilgrims who came to Mecca every year. This was especially true for members of Muhammad\u2019s own tribe, the Quraysh, who were the guardians of the Kaaba. Sensing a threat, Mecca\u2019s merchants and leaders offered Muhammad incentives to abandon his preaching, but he refused."

It is part of a Bengali song with the same title, written by Rabindranath Tagore in 1905.  The word sonar literally means 'made of gold', but in the song sonar Bangla may be interpreted to either express the preciousness of Bengal or refer to the colour of paddy fields before harvest.  History: The song was written in 1905 during the first partition of Bengal, when the ruling British Empire had an undivided India's province of Bengal split into two parts; the decision was announced on 19 July by the then-Viceroy of India Lord Curzon, taking effect on 16 October. This divide of Bengal, being along communal lines\u00e2\u0080\u0093East Bengal having a majority of Muslims and West Bengal having a majority of Hindus\u00e2\u0080\u0093is claimed to have undermined India's national movement against British imperialism and to have been politically motivated. Along with a host of others, songs such as this were meant to rekindle the unified spirit of Bengal, to raise public consciousness against the communal political divide.  The lyrics first appeared in the September issues of \"Bongodorshon\" and \"Baul\" simultaneously, in 1905. The song along with the musical notation (referred to as swaralipi in Bengali), first appeared in the periodical musical journal Shongeet Biggnan Probeshika in the same month and year. Indira Devi, Tagore's niece, Satyendranath Tagore's daughter, jotted down the musical notation hearing it from Tagore himself (this was the common norm, Tagore singing the song, and someone formally jotting down the musical notations). It is said that the music of this song was inspired by the Baul singer Gagan Harkara's song \"Ami Kothay Pabo Tare\". (\u00e0\u00a6\u0095\u00e0\u00a7\u008b\u00e0\u00a6\u00a5\u00e0\u00a6\u00be\u00e0\u00a6\u00af\u00e0\u00a6\u00bc \u00e0\u00a6\u00aa\u00e0\u00a6\u00be\u00e0\u00a6\u00ac\u00e0\u00a7\u008b \u00e0\u00a6\u00a4\u00e0\u00a6\u00be\u00e0\u00a6\u00b0\u00e0\u00a7\u0087)[3]  The first ten (10) lines of this song constitute Bangladesh's national anthem, adopted in 1971 during its liberation war. Only those lines are given in the following section. The instrumental orchestra rendition was composed by Samar Das.[4] The English translation below was done by Syed Ali Ahsan. Another Brahmo hymn composed and scored by Tagore (Jana Gana Mana) was selected as the national anthem of India.

The sal\u0101m (\u0633\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645, meaning 'peace') has become a religious salutation for Muslims[1][2] worldwide when greeting each other, though its use as a greeting pre-dates Islam, and is also common among Arabic speakers of other religions (such as Arab Christians and Mizrahi Jews). The phrase appears a total of 7 times in the Quran, each time as salamun \u02bfalaykum (Arabic: \u0633\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064c \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652).

    "question": "say something about muhammad, may god bless him and grant him peace",
    "answer": "Directing such question to a Muslim person may not sound well at all, because this question is one of the axioms for every Muslim,\u00a0 rather from the core of faith, because a Muslim\u2019s faith will not be complete without venerating the Messenger, may God\u2019s blessings and peace be upon him, and his reverence and devotion for him with everything he possesses, even his soul.2- Because defending him, may God\u2019s blessings and peace be upon him, is the title of his voluntary conditional love for the integrity of faith, and therefore, may God\u2019s blessings and peace be upon him says, \u201cNone of you believes until I am dearer to him than his son, his father, and the whole people. So his\u00a0defense\u00a0is above his defense of his soul, offspring, money and honor, and preceded those necessities, and it is known among all rational people that maintaining a pillar of something from damage and wastage is more important than the rest of its components.\u00a0How much more if the pillar is one of the pillars of Islam and faith. Accordingly, defending the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, is a great source of religion, and a great and venerable worship and closeness that we draw closer to God Almighty.Al-Khattabi said: \u201cSo what it means is that you be sincere in my love until you perish yourself in my obedience, and my satisfaction affects your desires, even if it is your perdition.\u201d\u00a0And as the Prophet, may God\u2019s blessings and peace be upon him, told him that the true sweetness of faith is in the love of God Almighty and His messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace. He said: \u201cThree things, whoever found them in him found the sweetness of faith: that God and His Messenger be dearer to him than others, and that he loves a person for Allah\u2019s sake only. And that he hates to return in disbelief as he hates to be thrown into the fire\u201d\u00a0.\u00a0As you can see, these three characteristics relate to the heart and the soul, and with them the heart is corrected and strengthened, and then the body is corrected, so the good life is straightend.\u00a0However, the answer to this question is a matter of reminding and alerting the heedless who are preoccupied with the concerns of worldly life at a time when the infidels have mastered the aggression against the status of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, in various ways, explicitly and implicitly. It therefore, became pertinent on every Muslim wherever he found himself to defend the honour of the Prophet, may God\u2019s blessings and peace be upon him and triumphs his Sunnah as much as he was able to, and this is not a matter of supererogatory or marginal interests.\u00a0Rather, it is a matter of faith, monotheism and obedience, and therefore we say \u2013 as a reminder and warning in a concise answer \u2013 we defend our Prophet and our beloved, may God\u2019s blessings and peace be upon him for reasons:Read Also: Focus on the Early History of Islam: A Refreshing Look at the Seerah (Part 3)Focus on the Early History of Islam: A Refreshing Look at the Seerah (Part 2)"

    "question": "then it",
    "answer": "The way to keep the pair straight is to focus on this basic difference: than is used when you're talking about comparisons; then is used when you're talking about something relating to time.People get tripped up on then and than all the time\u2014and why not? They look and sound so similar, and both words function as linguistic workhorses\u2014then is most often an adverb, while than is usually a conjunction\u2014which means that we mostly use them to connect more obviously significant nouns, verbs, and adjectives.So when did this pair get so confusing? Turns out they've always been that way. Linguistically speaking, they're identical twins. In Middle English, they were the same word; both spellings were used for all the various meanings. It's been a few hundred years, however, since English has treated them as distinct, which means we have to too. We could go back to Middle English, but we think that would be harder then\u2014um, that is, harder than\u2014mastering these.There's nothing more embarrassing then correcting someone's language only to realize that your correction contains its own error. Like maybe the one in our first sentence. Did you see it? That harmless little four-letter word then. It should have been than. "

    "question": "tell me about flatter",
    "answer": " Following are 15 quotes that talk about praise and flattery. Follow the advice given in these 15 inspirational quotes on praise and flattery, and you will be able to tell the difference between praise and flattery every time.  Praise is an actionable device to encourage a positive outcome. For instance, a teacher could praise her student by saying, \"John, your handwriting has improved since last week. Good job!\" Now, such words of praise can help John to improve his handwriting further. He knows what his teacher likes, and he can work on his handwriting to produce better results. However, if the teacher says, \"John, you're good in class. I think you're the best!\" these words are unspecific, vague, and offer no direction for improvement to the receiver. John will, of course, feel good about the kind words from his teacher, but he wouldn't know how to be better in his class.  Let praise or flattery not go into your head. While it is good to hear praise, accept it with a pinch of salt. Perhaps, the person who praised you is usually generous. Or perhaps, the person praising you wants something out of you. Flattery can be exhausting, even if they are generous. It is like eating too much sweet and feeling sick after a while. Praise, on the other hand, is measured, specific, and direct.  The difference lies in the intent of the words. You can praise someone for their actions, or the lack of it, while flattery can be vague, undefined, and even false. Here are some ways to spot the difference between praise and flattery. "

    "question": "tell me about muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam",
    "answer": "Muhammad was the prophet and founder of Islam. Most of his early life was spent as a merchant. At age 40, he began to have revelations from Allah that became the basis for the Koran and the foundation of Islam. By 630 he had unified most of Arabia under a single religion. As of 2015, there are over 1.8 billion Muslims in the world who profess, \u201cThere is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet.\u201dMuhammad was a prophet and founder of Islam.After the conflict with Mecca was finally settled, Muhammad took his first true Islamic pilgrimage to that city and in March, 632, he delivered his last sermon at Mount Arafat. Upon his return to Medina to his wife\u2019s home, he fell ill for several days. He died on June 8, 632, at the age of 62, and was buried at al-Masjid an-Nabawi (the Mosque of the Prophet) one of the first mosques built by Muhammad in Medina. Islamic tradition holds that the first persons to believe were his wife, Khadija and his close friend Abu Bakr (regarded as the successor to Muhammad by Sunni Muslims). Soon, Muhammad began to gather a small following, initially encountering no opposition. Most people in Mecca either ignored him or mocked him as just another prophet. However, when his message condemned idol worship and polytheism, many of Mecca\u2019s tribal leaders began to see Muhammad and his message as a threat. Besides going against long standing beliefs, the condemnation of idol worship had economic consequences for merchants who catered to the thousands of pilgrims who came to Mecca every year. This was especially true for members of Muhammad\u2019s own tribe, the Quraysh, who were the guardians of the Kaaba. Sensing a threat, Mecca\u2019s merchants and leaders offered Muhammad incentives to abandon his preaching, but he refused."
